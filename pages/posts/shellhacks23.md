ShellHacks 
> Florida's Largest Hackathon!Over 1,000 students from across the state and around the world - ShellHacks

## Leadup to the event

Not only was this the largest hackathon in florida but it was also my first hackathon. You might be thinking to yourself, what a way to introduce yourself to a hackathon! I'm not sure what I expected to be totally honest, but leading up to the event along with other UCF students and club mates I was getting excited for my first experience with a hackathon. Who wouldn't right? Florida's Largest hackathon any student would look forward to such an event with other like minded individuals and learning experiences. The Shellhacks team did an incredible job at getting the word out and promoting the event any questions I had I felt were answered with just a couple searches or through their hacker guide. After planning on making it to the event I was planning what Workshops I wanted to attend and for the career fair. In reality there wasn't much else for me to do but pack what I thought I might need maybe brainstorm a project and see if anyone wanted to work together and that was that, nothing more to do but wait for it to come.

## Day One

Friday September 15th 2023, Day one of ShellHacks. Day one of a 36 hour hackathon it was exciting upon arrival we were welcomed by the team into a large two story building. It was pretty easy to get into the building parking was right out front and it was that simple, after walking in and getting registered with a nametag and a wristband you were in! I had never set foot on FIU's campus until now, it was just about what I expected, after having visited a few south florida colleges it wasn't too much out of the ordinary but I definitely noticed how large the building was for the hackathon. To put this into context the entire building was reserved for the hackathon. I would say it's a pretty independent experience after that. All of the workshops are optional it's totally up to you what you want to go to or if you want to go at all.  Again the size of the hackathon is apparent from the beginning as all of the attendees are in that building exploring or setting up.
