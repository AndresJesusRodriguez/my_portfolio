# Andres Rodriguez

## Hey! My name is Andres Rodriguez

I'm a Front-End Web Developer and Student at The University of Central Florida, and a member of their registered student organization Design & Code. I am currently developing my skills in JavaScript, React, and node.js.

 Previously I was the Community Building Coordinator of Design & Code, and one of the founding officers of the registered student organization building the foundations of a collaborative environment for students interested in all aspects of Design and Code. I was also a part of the web team building the organizations initial website using React.

I am passionate about all things development! after switching majors arguably too many times... I fell in love with web development! I enjoy learning about new technologies and growing as a developer. Outside of development I am passionate about film, music, card games, design, and I enjoy going to the gym. lately I've found myself growing my vinyl collection as well as learning about accessability in the web.

This portfolio is built with **Next.js** and a library called [Nextra](https://nextra.vercel.app/). It allows you to write Markdown and focus on the _content_ of your portfolio.
