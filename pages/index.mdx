# Andres Rodriguez

Hey! My name is Andres Rodriguez, I'm a Front-End Web Developer and Student at The University of Central Florida.

I am currently developing my skills in JavaScript, React, and node.js. I am actively looking for Internship Opportunities and building projects as I learn new technologies. I am a current member of the Design & Code club at UCF. Previously I was their Community Building Coordinator and one of the founding officers of the registered student organization building the foundations of a collaborative environment for students interested in all aspects of Design and Code. I was also a part of the web team building the organizations initial website using react.

I am passionate about all things development! after switching majors arguably too many times... I fell in love with web development! I enjoy learning about new technologies and growing as a developer. Outside of development I am passionate about film, music, card games, design, and I enjoy going to the gym. lately I've found myself growing my vinyl collection as well as learning about accessability in the web.
